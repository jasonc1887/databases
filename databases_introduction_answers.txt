2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

A: If data should persist after ending an application, a database should be used to store the data. Additionally databases can be accessed by multiple applications simultaneously and should be used when needing to search for or manipulate data. A text file is appropriate if the file does not meet the needs listed above. For example a document like an essay being accessed by one individual at a time, saved, then passed along to someone else to review, edit, etc. 

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

A: SQL is a declarative language vs procedural, meaning the programmer focuses on WHAT they are trying to find out, rather than HOW the item or object is found. 

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

A: A database is made up of data in a binary file format, structured so that a system can easily read and manipulate data of varying data types. A table of columns and rows is used to store this data in an organized, understandable way. SQL is used to communicate with the database. 

5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

A: Tables are used as a visual representation of what is happening within a database. Tables are made up of columns, which structure like-data together, and rows which hold the values inside each cell to create the table. 

6. List three data types that can be used in a table.

A: String, integer, object
